# ck-compiler-gym

## TODO
- make sure that observation vector is working properly or switch to an IR or bc representation
- figure out how to select default dataset
- figure out whether I need to apply transformations to all bc files or just the main
- make sure timing works
- test that dependencies are working by pulling fresh repo on different machine with ck
